# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Using YOLOv5

This repository presents a deep learning-based object detection model for identifying and localizing brain tumors from MRI scans using an enhanced YOLOv5 architecture. The project focuses on classifying three tumor typesâ€”**glioma**, **meningioma**, and **pituitary tumor**â€”using high-resolution annotated MRI images.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The model is built on YOLOv5s and incorporates:
- ðŸ”² **SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling)** for multi-scale feature representation
- ðŸŽ¯ **ESA (Enhanced Spatial Attention)** for spatial region focus
- ðŸ“¦ **SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation)** for channel-wise recalibration
- ðŸ”§ **Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna (Bayesian Optimization)**

The final model achieves:
- **mAP@0.5:** `0.934`
- **Precision:** `0.924`
- **Recall:** `0.883`
- **Inference speed:** ~8.4 ms/image
